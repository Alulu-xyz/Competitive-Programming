    // TIME COMPLEXITY.

    // time complexity of an algo is denoted as O(...). usually the dots are replaces by n.
    // Where n will be the amount of nested loops in an algo.
    // so if you have one loop it will be denoted as O(n); and if you have two nested,
    // it will be denoted as O(n^2).
    
    // PHASES
    // if the algo has more phases, the total time of complexity is the largest time complexity in a single phace.
    // if the algo has: O(n), O(n^2), and O(n); the total time complexity is: O(n^2).
